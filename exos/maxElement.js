/**
 The maximum element is the only element whose next is smaller than it. If there is no next smaller element, then there is no rotation (last element is the maximum). We check this condition for middle element by comparing it with elements at mid â€“ 1 and mid + 1.
If maximum element is not at middle (neither mid nor mid + 1), then maximum element lies in either left half or right half.
If middle element is greater than the last element, then the maximum element lies in the left half.
Else maximum element lies in the right half.
